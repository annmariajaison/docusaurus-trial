![Screenshot](img/screenshot.png)

There are many resource Products using WIZnet Ethernet chip.

### Arduino Compatible

#### Arduino Ethernet Shield




This [Ethernet Shield](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoEthernetShield) which is based on the [Wiznet](https://www.wiznet.io/) [W5100](https://www.wiznet.io/) [Ethernet Chip](https://www.wiznet.io/) gives you an easy way to get your
Arduino Online.
It is directly supported by official Ethernet Library. It adds a micro-SD card slot, which can be used to store
files for serving over the network.

#### Arduino Ethernet Shield R2.0
